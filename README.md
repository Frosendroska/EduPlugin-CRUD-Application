There is one table "books", which stores a books list.The following data should be stored in the table:
`id`, `title`, `description`, `author` (name and last name), `isbn` – ISBN of the book, `printYear`, `readAlready` (boolean).

Create a standard CRUD application with a possibility to `add` new book, `update` an existing one 
(e.g. mark the book as read or replace a book by a new edition), `delete` and `search` by field.
